Thanks for purchasing this asset.

How to use these textures?
Just drag and drop the materials onto your (UV-unwrapped) mesh.

Contents:
- 10 concrete ground and wall textures, with heightmaps and specular maps, added to materials.
- a special shader for use of the specular maps

For questions or more information see my website (bitsofrealism.wordpress.com) or just write a review.
